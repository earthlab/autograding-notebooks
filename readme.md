Sample notebooks and notes for a project aimed at autograding Jupyter notebooks
for [EarthLab](https://www.earthdatascience.org/) at the University of Colorado.

We are using [nbgrader](https://github.com/jupyter/nbgrader) for this project,
and adding functionality for partial credit in
[this fork](https://github.com/kcranston/nbgrader).

See `nbgrader_local_dev.md` for notes on setting up a local nbgrader workflow.

The `notebooks` dir contains example notebooks for the project. Autograding
functionality will not be visible if nbgrader is not installed.

The `scripts` dir contains scripts for managing the interaction between
nbgrader and GitHub Classroom (modified from versions obtained from @jedbrown).
